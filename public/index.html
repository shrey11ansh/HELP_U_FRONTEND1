        <h1>EVENTS</h1>
        <p>Events is where extracurricular activities play a vital role. These activities, during college life, keep you positive, fresh, energetic and go a long way in making you more productive. Not only do they lighten your mood, but they also help in shaping your overall personality and interpersonal skills.
